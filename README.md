submission by: BROSOTO, MICO, TEOPE <br>

This is Bids to Pick. An application where users can buy and sell different products. The users may sell by posting a product, setting a starting bidding price for it, and setting a due date (end of bidding). Once the product has been posted, other users may buy the product by placing their bids. By the end of the due date, the user with the highest bid will be the one eligible to avail the product.
